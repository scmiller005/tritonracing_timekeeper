# Triton Racing Timekeeper v1.2
Timekeeper, also known as “the timing gate,” is Triton Racing’s in-house lap and acceleration timing system used to assist the team with testing cars and validating designs. Utilizing an Arduino Nano, the gate operates on break-beam laser inputs to start and stop a stopwatch. The system has two gates, one that acts as a home base (the NEAR gate) and one that acts as a FAR gate, which wirelessly transmits data to the NEAR gate from anywhere on the course. The gates can operate in single- or multi-gate mode.

This repo includes the working versions of the code for the NEAR gate and FAR gate.

Future plans for the project include designing and implementing PCBs for both gate modules, manufacturing custom enclosure for both modules, and expanding the system to include multiple FAR gates for accurate, wireless sector timing.
